/* A gimmick to make massive numbers of reallocs quicker.  The result is
 * a number >= the input.  In PyNode_AddChild, it's used like so, when
 * we're about to add child number current_size + 1:
 *
 *     if XXXROUNDUP(current_size) < XXXROUNDUP(current_size + 1):
 *         allocate space for XXXROUNDUP(current_size + 1) total children
 *     else:
 *         we already have enough space
 *
 * Since a node starts out empty, we must have
 *
 *     XXXROUNDUP(0) < XXXROUNDUP(1)
 *
 * so that we allocate space for the first child.  One-child nodes are very
 * common (presumably that would change if we used a more abstract form
 * of syntax tree), so to avoid wasting memory it's desirable that
 * XXXROUNDUP(1) == 1.  That in turn forces XXXROUNDUP(0) == 0.
 *
 * Else for 2 <= n <= 128, we round up to the closest multiple of 4.  Why 4?
 * Rounding up to a multiple of an exact power of 2 is very efficient, and
 * most nodes with more than one child have <= 4 kids.
 *
 * Else we call fancy_roundup() to grow proportionately to n.  We've got an
 * extreme case then (like test_longexp.py), and on many platforms doing
 * anything less than proportional growth leads to exorbitant runtime
 * (e.g., MacPython), or extreme fragmentation of user address space (e.g.,
 * Win98).
 *
 * In a run of compileall across the 2.3a0 Lib directory, Andrew MacIntyre
 * reported that, with this scheme, 89% of PyObject_REALLOC calls in
 * PyNode_AddChild passed 1 for the size, and 9% passed 4.  So this usually
 * wastes very little memory, but is very effective at sidestepping
 * platform-realloc disasters on vulnernable platforms.
 *
 * Note that this would be straightforward if a node stored its current
 * capacity.  The code is tricky to avoid that.
